# Streaming-SMS-Notifications
  
###Twitch 
 
For this project we will be following along with a freecode camp tutorial on how to set up an sms notification for whenever your favorite Twitch Streamer goes live.

During this project, contributors will become more familiar with API's specifically Twitch API and Twilio API. Also if contributors are unfamiliar with Python which will be the language we are using for this project this is a great chance to get used to it and learn something new to add to your resume.
 
###Mixxer
 
It's boring to follow a tutorial and call it your own so we will be taking this project a step further by not only trying to set up an sms notification for twitch but to also set up a notification system for Mixxer just in case any one is interested in following Ninja or any other high quality streamers on the Mixxer site. This will also get contributors familiar with Mixxer's API and developer tools.

For this project we will need around five people to contribute via Github and assigned duties. Github is required in order to participate in the development of this project because that is where we will be posting files and assigning work. So if someone wants to join in on the project they will need to sign up for Github. The Sign up process takes thirty seconds.
